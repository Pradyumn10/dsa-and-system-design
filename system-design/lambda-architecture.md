##### Benefits
* No Server Management – you do not have to install, maintain, or administer any software.
* Flexible Scaling – your application can be either automatically scaled or scaled by the adjustment of its capacity
* Automated High Availability – refers to the fact that serverless applications have already built-in availability and faults tolerance. It represents a guarantee that all requests will get a response about whether they were successful or not.
* Business Agility – React in real-time to changing business/market scenarios

##### Challenges:
* Complexity – lambda architectures can be highly complex. Administrators must typically maintain two separate code bases for batch and streaming layers, which can make debugging difficult.
